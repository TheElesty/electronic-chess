# Manufacturing

All parts in thes folders are needed for completing chess board, clocks and piece box (with all chess figures). Some files need to be made multiple times. Thes files has number in name that show how many times it should be made.

## Laser cutting
Files are prepared for light burn, black object are meant to buy cut, all other colors are used for engravin. All cut setting need to be changed by user depending on used material - sould be used 4mm playwood. some files has rad color used for marking pieces for assembly.

## Printing
Parts are made on both FDM and SLA printer. All parts has prepared file for printing (specific setting for supports etc. should make user depending on printer), SLA prints has suports premade if needed (light tunnels). All FDM parts are meda from PETG - I don't recomend use of PLA.
