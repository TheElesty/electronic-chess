### Diploma thesis project

This is my implementation for electronic chess board. It uses NFC MFRC522 for pieces detection. UI consist of TFT LCD display, adressable LED and endstops/rotary encoder for input. 

This repository contains all files needed to manufacture, assemble and program electronic chessboard.

Folders contains
- [board_model](board_model/README.md) - all 3D models created in Fusion 360
- [electronic_chess](electronic_chess/README.md) - whole firmware created in Arduino IDE
- [manufacturing](manufacturing/README.md) - all files for 3D printing (prepared in Bambu studio, Anycubic Workshop and LightBurn)
- [pcb_schematics](pcb_schematics/README.md) - all schematics created in Eagle

Each directory has it own README with instructions, tutorials, etc.
